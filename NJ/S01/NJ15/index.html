      ðŸ’”TRUST ISSUES with setTimeout()
    </h1>
    <h2 style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 20px">
      ðŸ¤” The First rule of JavaScript : <br />
      Do not block the main thread (as JS is a single threaded(only 1 callstack
      language). <br />
      - In code example, we are blocking the main thread. Observe Question and
      Output. <br />
      - setTimeout guarantees that it will take at least the given timer to
      execute the code. <br />
      - JS is a synchronous single threaded language. With just 1 thread it runs
      all pieces of code. It becomes kind of an interpreter language, and runs
      code very fast inside browser (no need to wait for code to be compiled)
      (JIT - Just in time compilation). And there are still ways to do async
      operations as well.
