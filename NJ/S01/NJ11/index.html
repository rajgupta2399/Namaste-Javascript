      ðŸ”¥ FIRST CLASS FUNCTIONS
    </h1>
    <h2 style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 20px">
      A first-class function is a concept in programming languages where
      functions are treated as first-class citizens. This allows us to pass
      functions as arguments, return them from other functions, and assign them
      to variables. <br> 1) Assigned to variables: Functions can be stored in
      variables, making them easily accessible and re-usable. <br> 2) Passed as
      arguments: Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions,
      enabling powerful patterns like callback functions. <br> 3) Returned from
      functions: Functions can be the result of another function, allowing for
      the creation of higher-order functions.
