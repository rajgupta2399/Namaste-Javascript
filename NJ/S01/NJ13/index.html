      What is Call Stack..? <br />
      Call Stack that contains all called functions. When we call a function for
      its execution, we are pushing it into the stack. It is popped out of the
      stack when the execution is completed.

      What is WEB APIs..? <br />
      WEB APIs are responsible for filling the callback queue, providing many
      features such as the ability to make a setTimeout, DOM events, Fetch,
      console etc.

    <h2 style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 20px">
      What is Callback Queue..? <br />
      CALLBACK QUEUE is also known as, Message Queue or Event Queue. With this
      queue, we have the callbacks from event table. The functions are waiting
      to be dequeued and put on the Call Stack.
    </h2>
    <h2 style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 20px">
      What is Event Loop..? <br />
      The event loop understands this and makes sure that the callbacks from the
      Callback Queue are added to the Call Stack, once the Call Stack is empty.
      The event loop, the web APIs and the callback queue are not part of the
      JavaScript engine, itâ€™s a part of browserâ€™s JavaScript runtime
      environment.

    <h2 style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 20px">
      What is Microtask Queue..? <br />
      ES6 introduced the concept of job queue/micro-task queue which is used by
      Promises in JavaScript, they use the microtask queue to run their
      callbacks. The difference between the callback queue and the microtask
      queue is that the microtask queue has a higher priority than the callback
      queue, which means that promise jobs inside the micro-task queue will be
      executed before the callbacks inside the callback queue.
