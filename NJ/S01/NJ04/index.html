      Understand how Functions work behind the scenes in JavaScript.What happens
      when a function is executed/invoked inside the JS Engine. This video
      covers an in-depth analysis of function execution and its variable
      environments. Whenever a function is invoked in JavaScript a functional
      Execution Context is created and memory is allocated. Once the memory is
      allocated to the variables and functions, then the code is executed
      synchronously, one line at a time.
