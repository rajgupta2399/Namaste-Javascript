      ðŸ”¥ BLOCK SCOPE & Shadowing in JS
    </h1>
    <h2 style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 20px">
      ðŸ’¡Block : A block is used to combine multiple Javascript statements into
      one group. we need to group these statements together so that we can use
      multiple statements in place where the JavaScript excepts only one
      statement.
    </h2>

    <h2 style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 20px">
      ðŸ’¡Block Scope : Block scope refers to the scope created by a pair of curly
      braces {}. Variables declared inside a block (using let or const) are only
      accessible within that block, and they are not accessible outside of it.
    </h2>

    <h2 style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 20px">
      ðŸ’¡Shadowing : Shadowing in JavaScript occurs when a variable declared in a
      block has the same name as a variable declared in an outer scope. In such
      cases, the inner variable "shadows" or overrides the outer variable within
      its scope. As a result, the inner variable takes precedence and is used
      within the local scope.
