      What is Callback Functions..? <br />
      A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function. The
      function receiving the callback can invoke it later, often asynchronously.
      Callbacks are everywhere in JS.

      What is Blocking the Main Thread..?? <br />
      blocking the main thread happens when an operation takes a long time to
      execute and prevents other tasks, including user interactions and
      rendering updates, from being processed. This is problematic because
      JavaScript runs on a single-threaded event loop, meaning it can only
      handle one task at a time on the main thread.

      Closures with Event Listener : <br> closures with event listeners is a common
      pattern in JavaScript, enabling the creation of functions that retain
      access to variables in their lexical scope even after the outer function
      has finished execution. This allows for maintaining state or encapsulating
      behavior when handling events.
